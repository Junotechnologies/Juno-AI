# ========================================
# GLOBAL DEFAULT VALUES
# ========================================
# This file contains default values that are common across all environments.
# Environment-specific overrides should be placed in environments/*.tfvars
# 
# IMPORTANT: This file is for EXAMPLES only. The actual terraform.tfvars
# is ignored by git for security. Copy this to terraform.tfvars and customize.

# These values are typically overridden in environment-specific files
# Leave them commented out to use the defaults from variables.tf

# region      = "us-central1"
# bq_location = "US"

# Common labels applied to all resources
# labels = {
#   managed_by  = "terraform"
#   project     = "juno-analytics"
#   cost_center = "engineering"
#   team        = "data-platform"
# }
